Since the exercise was aimed at identifying the exercise pattern which had more than 1 possible values, So I have used Random Forest for it. 
To create the model, initially exploratory data analysis was done to check any missing values present in the data. Since at checking the count of 
missing values present was even more than 97% in some of the variables, those variables were completely removed from the analysis. Rest the 
model was created using all the varaibles which were left after the missing values removal. To check the uniformity of the two Datasets- Testing and
training, we used a package called "funmodeling" which tells the type of varaible. On check, there were a couple of variables which were not 
having similar datatypes, So we converted them to the relevant data type because the prediction would not take place if the variables in the testing 
and training datasets are of different types.

Also for two variables, the data type was same but the levels of the variable was not similar in the two datasets. If levels of the two datasets 
are not matched it doesnot let us do the predictions. 

This was the model was built using all the variables which had non null values applying Random forest.
